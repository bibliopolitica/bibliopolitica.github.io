<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> Today I'm speaking with environmental health and justice advocate, Elva Yañez. The interview was conducted for Bibliopolítica, a digital history of the Chicano Studies Library. The interview took place at Whittier College on January 10th, 2023, recorded by Sonia Chaidez. Richard Chabrán, former coordinator of the Chicano Studies Library, is here with us today for the interview. The interviewer is Amanda Belantara.</p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> Thank you for joining us today, Elva. Could you start off please by introducing yourself and giving us a bit of background about yourself and your work?</p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b>  Sure. My name is Elva Yañez. I live in Los Angeles. I've been working in the field of public health for the last 30 years, I would say. Prior to that, I was a librarian, a research librarian. I worked in a variety of different settings. And I got my start in libraries at the UC Berkeley Chicano Studies Library. Way back, I would say 1971 or early 72, I can't remember exactly, but I was a work study student. The way I got introduced to the library was by taking a bibliography one class. I got kind of got my mind blown. And that's how I kind of looked around and found Jose Arce. And he was able to get me a position with the emerging library. - So I understand that you actually studied at Mills College in Oakland.</p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> You mentioned the bibliography one class. How did you learn about the Chicano Studies Library? And what was it like for you to discover it? </p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> So I went to UC Berkeley for two years when they cut my financial aid.  I transferred over to Mills because they were offering me a full scholarship. So I had been at UC Berkeley and I had taken the bibliography one course at UC Berkeley. At that point in time, the library was not recognized by the UC system. So I started poking around. I was very much into the whole Chicano Movement and I searched around and found Jose. And what he was doing sounded like the right fit for me. Working in a traditional library was never a right fit for me. So I don't even know how he put me onto the classification system, but that's where I immediately went. I was fascinated by the idea of classification and the idea of a lexicon. I think it's just kind of hit me how ridiculous the UC classification, was it LC, excuse me, Library of Congress Classification system was and the subject headings, the Library of Congress Classification system. It was at best offensive and at worst racist. And I didn't have the words for it at that time, but I think it evolved in my awareness as very much a proponent of white supremacy. And the fact that the library was not recognized, it was not only were those terminologies, those vocabularies, lexicons, classification systems, a way of putting others into a box, but the libraries themselves, the collections themselves were seen as invalid in that system. And I think that really upset me. And I think it upset a lot of people who gave them an impetus to create and establish these institutions and struggle through sort of a period of lack of formality. It was kind of like going from a really clear idea of wanting a collection for a new area of study to kind of going into a desert, we were figuring it out. There are all these young Chicanos who had no idea what libraries were about, but I remember talking to people about it. It's kind of like this not rocket science, right? This is very learnable, right? Very practical. And then coming out on the other side with the tools, modifications of classification systems, modifications of subject heading lists that really served as the foundation for these collections. In addition to the hard work of securing the money and those more administrative tasks, there was a clear focus on how is knowledge perceived differently by people who are working in this new field, people who are establishing this new field, the scholars who were developing this new field. So it was pretty exciting.</p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> Definitely, and I wanna go into the Chicano classification system and the thesaurus a little bit later on. But before we get there, I just wanna backtrack for a minute and see if you can recall one of your early experiences of connecting with Jose and visiting the library. What was it like for you to first encounter and experience the library?</p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> I think it was mind blowing in a sense to be doing such creative work. And I was so impressed with Jose, right? He was a little intimidating. He was very serious, no nonsense, and had a really clear vision. And that was very attractive and inspiring. So yeah, I got very excited just about the, I guess the power of knowledge in the main library and the Bibliography I class and immediately being able to find Jose and just being totally motivated by his enthusiasm, by his vision. And he was a planner, right? I work with a lot of planners now and it's just a very different orientation than library science. So his vision was much bigger and much more exciting, I think. </p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> You mentioned that you got a work study to be employed at the Chicano Studies Library. Can you talk a little bit about when you started working there and who you worked with at the time besides Jose?</p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> It was a very early, early days. So it was like, as I recall, not a whole lot of structure, just trying to figure it out. And I didn't even know what Jose was doing, but when he talked to me, it was really clear that he wanted somebody to do the classification work. And I think just my interest in it, that's where he sort of directed me into that. And like I said, I was a little bit into, he was older, I think he was a graduate student at that time. So he was an older person and I was kind of intimidated, but I really respected what he said and was happy to be mentored, if you will, by somebody like Jose.</p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> You mentioned that he was excited to work with you on the classification. Did Jose already have a plan to start an alternative classification? Or was that something that you came up with him together as you started perusing the collection? Could you talk about how the plans for it really took off?</p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> I really can't remember the precise details, but it was clearly of interest to him and it was of interest to me. And he just assigned me the task of looking at the classification system and seeing what we could do with it. And I'm very kind of detail oriented and no matter what work I've done, I've always kind of dive deep into the weeds, if you will, and kind of nerdy. So yeah, I just nerded out on the whole idea of the classification system and this idea that the university library system, world-class library system rejected the idea of a special collection for this new department. I don't want to rag on librarians because I became a librarian, right? But there was at that time and in that system, there was a lot of resistance to the idea of establishing a special collection that was not within the library system. So what would have happened if that had been the case is that the whole collection would have been distributed across multiple libraries. And within those libraries, they would have been stacked in the days when you would be looking at the books themselves as a way of scanning a collection, books about Chicano in education would be right next to a book about blacks in education in very general classification. And that just seemed ridiculous given what was the intent of the Chicano Studies scholars who wanted their collection altogether, right? </p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> You mentioned that you might not have really in-depth memories of the process, but do you remember what it was like for you as a young student trying to imagine how to classify this new collection? How did you start? And one of the things that Richard's conveyed to me in the past is that there's a special class in the PX section. Could you talk a little bit about that if you have memories of it?</p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> You know, what I recall is that I had to get a broad awareness and understanding of the entire LC classification system. So it was kind of trying to understand where we fit in, where that book about bilingual education would fit into another field that was brand new, right? Where was it gonna fit into this larger system? And at the end of the day where you ended up with these very long classification numbers, it just was ludicrous because if you actually did correct classification, your number would be quite large. And this idea of having a classification number that reflected actually the worldview or world understanding classification of knowledge developed in the late 1800s or early 1900s. It's like, why would we do that? I mean, at the time, if you look back historically when those systems were created, eugenics were okay. Absolutely no awareness at the time that the scientific method of classifying people was a problem. And I think Jose understood it and I understood it very quickly. I think what we recognized was that by not following those rules, by disrupting the system and saying, no, we're gonna put them all together and we're gonna adapt the system to work for a special collection that brings all the books together and avoids that whole, the most problematic nature of the classification system. It's where knowledge is subdivided to the point of where you finally get to the other and you fit them in, right? It's like, no, the worldview in that collection is the Chicano Studies Library, the Chicano Studies universe of scholarly information, right? So it turned the whole system on its head and said, no, this is a center of the universe from which we understand knowledge and classify knowledge. </p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> In addition to creating the Chicano classification system, the Chicano Studies Library staff worked with other librarians across the Southwest to create the Chicano Periodical Index and the Chicano Thesaurus. Can you tell us about your contributions to the Thesaurus? </p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> Once you've dealt with the classification system, then it naturally evolves into having to address the subject heading. I think because it was sort of like a continuation in terms of the thinking and understanding and problem solving, I think I went to Mexico for a year and then came back. And I came back and I was at Mills College at the time, but I wanted to continue to work in the Chicano Studies Library. So I was able to get funding from the American Library Association Social Responsibility Roundtable or something like that. I wrote a proposal, like a page, and went to the Social Responsibility Roundtable Meeting that was at UC Berkeley and pitched them the idea. And they were very excited, right? These are the liberal of the liberals in libraries and a lot of very progressive people in the system, but the system itself is very conservative and old and rigid. So got some funding. I was able to use that funding and Richard was able to figure out the UC being able to receive that money and then give it back to me as part of my work study wage. Yeah, that was how we made it happen in terms of my working on it. The work itself, it was basically very similar in nature is that the subject headings, any document, any book, any paper, has multiple subjects that it covers, right? And in the mainstream library system, you would get whatever the topic area, education, for example, and then there would be a term for Mexican Americans, right? And I can't remember the details, but it was sort of like you're put into boxes that didn't quite match the way knowledge was organized in a cohesive collection. And so the challenge was to, how do you modify the subject headings for such a collection while retaining the dignity, if you will, of the subject matter, right? I mean, it would be things like, almost a way of demeaning and ghettoizing Mexican Americans, Chicanos, because that's what the language of the subject headings of the Library of Congress did, right? I know that I'm not explaining this well, but it's kind of like, how do you look at knowledge conveyed in a book and make it relevant to the intent of the collection? And rather than demeaning or, you know, boxing people into a very narrow category of other, you're more expansive. You know, you have that freedom to sort of be respectful and precise at the same time. </p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> According to some of the project documentation that I've looked at in the process of doing some research about the library and the thesaurus, I've seen that you played a major role in terms of advising on the hierarchical listings within the thesaurus, and that you made some suggestions when Lillian Castillo-Speed was updating the thesaurus in the 2000s. Could you share a little bit more about your direct involvement or advising on the thesaurus? </p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> I really can't remember quite what the tasks that was put before me, but after the Chicano Studies Library, I kind of went on in library work to specialize in the saurae and those kinds of issues at the LA Times, at the Spanish-speaking Mental Health Research Center, at the Bay Area Bilingual Education Leads Libraries, all of which were doing that kind of like deep dive into creating systems that made sense. Not, and at the time, we weren't digitized back in the Chicano Studies Library, but then we were moving forward, well, the world was moving forward to a more digital reality. I'm assuming that it was kind of really sort of looking at that and taking that into account as we were sort of going further down the path of Chicano Studies librarianship. It wasn't just classifying books and putting them on the shelves and checking them out to people. I think that's the thing that I recall. More of it was like a creative process, a puzzle in a sense, right? How do you deal with the parameters or the requirements of classification while dealing with this very unique population that has its own societal parameters as well, right? And each group of what would be considered others has that reality. So it's kind of like layering things on and then pulling things back and modifying the terminology, the lexicon, to really follow the rules of lexicon development, hierarchy, for example, while not putting people into boxes or putting knowledge into very limited categories that are not necessarily helpful. I mean, it's really easy to get sort of lost in the nitty gritty, right? It's kind of like, well, if I do this, and to me, it's a challenge of strategy and more traditional classification, right? What's this about? But then the strategic elements of, well, how do we create that structure for people's knowledge to go into? -</p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> Elva, I was curious what you would think. I don't know if you're aware, but the Chicano Thesaurus was actually added or accepted by the Library of Congress as an official alternative vocabulary. So for anybody that might be cataloging materials, they are allowed to, because the Chicano Thesaurus has been officially accepted by the Library of Congress. Somebody can, when describing materials, use a special code within the machine readable catalog record to indicate that they're using a term from the Chicano Thesaurus. So I would be curious what your perspective is on that, because it was a lot of work from a group of dedicated individuals to realize the thesaurus. What do you think about it being added and made available as an alternative form? And what do you think could be done to expand awareness so that libraries know that they can incorporate the Chicano Thesaurus terms instead of having to use the ones that are included in Library of Congress, subject heading lists?</p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> First of all, I think it's about time. The work that got carried on after I had moved on was done by people like Richard and Lily Castillo-Speed and others. That level of integrity is just demonstrated by the fact that the Library of Congress took that work. It was Yeoman's work. It was sort of groundbreaking work. And it's not really, I don't think, a very easy topic to understand, right, or to do, but really valuable, just sort of foundational, right, to institutions like the Chicano Studies Library at UC Berkeley or anywhere else. It's like, if you don't have those tools, you could, and then there's no consistency across the field that's cataloging materials and you don't have those sort of basic tools. It's kind of a mess. I think creating order in this process was really a valuable thing to do. Even though many people didn't understand what they were doing, it was kind of like super important. So after I went on, I think the continuation of that work really is phenomenal. Everybody who worked on that tool was totally committed. So I think it's long overdue. It would have been amazing if the UC Library System had embraced those efforts earlier. And the fact that I was trying to find anything on the Chicano Studies Library's thesaurus makes me think that there still is a way to go, that it really needs to be elevated. So I'm glad you're doing this. Hopefully it will sort of make a dent. But, you know, sometimes when people are marginalized, pushed to the side, the determination and the commitment is enhanced by that, right? Without the rejection, without the refusal to integrate materials in a way that made sense for a new body of knowledge to move forward. That was a huge impetus for what happened. And I'm glad I had something to do with that.</p>
<p><b>Amanda Belantara:</b> And what impact would you say the library or working at the library, what impact did it have on you as a person and community member or your career?</p>
<p><b>Elva Yañez:</b> So that's an interesting journey. And, you know, I was a librarian until like around 1991. Oh no, 1990, I would say. And the reason I got into libraries in the first place was because it was an issue that needed to be dealt with. It was an injustice, if you will, to sort of understand the science behind and the philosophy and the belief system behind a cataloging system, a classification system and subject headings, right? Not something that a lot of people were into, but that's what touched me. I think the power of libraries has stayed with me, even though I left the field. I started libraries after I left and had hired librarians to create collections. And we created an alcohol industry tracking database that advocates were able to then follow the misdeeds of the alcohol industry, did that at the Americans for Non-Smokers Rights and that online system was able to help advocates track bad behavior of the tobacco industry. So, you know, it's kind of resonated in my career. Most recently, I'm on the Federal Reconciliation In Place Names Committee. It's dealing with the racist names that were given to physical features through the Department of the Interior. So the National Part System is looking at all the terms that they've used to classify part features like valleys and ridges and mountains and so forth, and trying to get rid of those racist names. That's a whole other type of nomenclature that comes from the same period and primarily during Western expansion, where, you know, you just have these names that you think about Native Americans or Mexican Americans or African Americans wanting to go to a park that refers to them in a degrading manner. It's a little bit different than classification, you know, that's structured and hierarchical. It's just across the board, offensive. So changing that has similar technical challenges of process, and I had no idea. There are people who study this, people who are into it, and they're usually geographers. That's been very interesting. So kind of merging that whole notion of classification, naming, and the current work I'm doing, which is on the built environment, land use, and parks. o it totally changed my life. The vibrancy that evolved out of the Chicano Studies Library, I think it impacted, you know, thousands of people, if you were to look back. Not just those who worked there, but those who relied upon it for both professional, educational, and social enhancement for their lives. It's deep, it's very deep.</p>
